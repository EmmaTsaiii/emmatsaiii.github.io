         		   <h4>Overview</h4>
         		   <p>FitBuddy is a workout app for everyone who is looking to start or reestablish a workout routine. 
                     Apart from the inbuilt exercises and programs, the app introduces the opportunity for users to 
                     choose workouts based on the size of their available space, and support other users within the 
                     community. The app also allows users to video call their friend and work out together. Ultimately, 
                     FitBuddy aims to motivate people conduct physical activity and help them maintain or retrieve 
                     healthy lifestyles.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Objective</h4>
                  <p>This project is to understand how to improve and motivate people in performing more physical 
                     activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and produce a working prototype to assist users achieve 
                     their goals in an UX practice.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Workflow</h4>
                  <img src="images/FitBuddy/flow.svg" class="img-responsive post-image" style="width:100%" alt="Blog">
                     <div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.freepik.com" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></div>

                  <br>
                  <h4>Background Research</h4>
                  <p>The limitations and restrictions put in place during the pandemic have demotivated people from 
                     being physically active as they lose their usual routines. Aside from mental exhaustions, people 
                     are also less likely to exercise or do relaxing activities such as yoga in general. In an effort 
                     to motivate people to be more active and create a healthy fitness routine, it’s essential for 
                     organisations to promote the importance of being active and how people can start doing so. We 
                     found that the key factor in motivating people is for them to have their own intrinsic (personal) 
                     reason or purpose to work out. Additionally, having diverse exercise and tailoring options, right 
                     atmosphere, environment or space, a motivation incentive system and an accountable and motivating 
                     partner also make it easier for people to start being active again.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Research Findings</h4>
                  <img src="images/FitBuddy/findings.svg" class="img-responsive post-image" style="width:100%" alt="Blog">
                  <div>Icons made by <a href="https://www.freepik.com" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></div>                 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Emphasis</h4>
                  <p>With the research and analysis in mind, we completed two user personas that allow us to visualize 
                     users’ needs and frustrations.</p>

                  <br>
                  <h4>Analyze</h4>
                  <p>To understand what the current products on the market have to offer, we, a group of three, performed 
                     an online ethnographic study and a competitor analysis over 12 existent products. Most of the similar 
                     products around the market offer support network, progress trackers, a sense of customization, a 
                     variety of workout types and levels of difficulty. However, users would like to have more 
                     personalization and customization options, in-depth exercise instructions and an Immersive user 
                     experience.</p>
                  <br>
                  <blockquote>
                     <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                     <p>How can we promote and motivate people conduct physical activity especially living in a limited 
                        space and lacking social support?</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Iteration</h4>
                  <p>Each of us produced an idea that response to the user needs including:</p>
                  <p>1.	A habit tracker inspired app that focuses on both mental and physical health and is high in customization.</p>
                  <p>2.	A gamification style app that embedded video call feature for users to exercise with their friends.</p>
                  <p>3.	A spatial scanner app that generates exercises based on users’ available space.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>We then presented these ideas to our ideal users for feedback and improvements. 
                     It was decided as a team that we combined the gamification style app and the spatial scanner app. 
                     With two more rounds of iteration and user testing, the FitBuddy app was born.</p>
