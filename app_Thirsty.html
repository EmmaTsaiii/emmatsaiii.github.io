         		   <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <br>
         		   <p>This project aims to create a digital and interactive solution that encourages people in Australia 
                     to reduce the purchases of single-use plastic water bottles and supports sustainable communities in 
                     everyday lives. The design focuses on behavioural patterns and the psychology behind users' 
                     decision-making processes. The Thirsty bottle encourages the use of reusable water bottles. It is 
                     easy to carry, purifies and keeps the water cold and syncs with the Thirsty app. The app motivates 
                     users to maintain their sustainable and healthy life styles to eventually reducing the overall 
                     plastic bottles purchased.</p>

                 <!-- Research -->
                 <div class="blog-comment">
                  <h5 class="h5-thirsty">Research</h5>
                  <h3>Literature Research</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p>In 2015 Australia, approximately 5.7 million people consumed bottled water across any 7 day period 
                     ("Bottled water consumption booming", 2020), and the Single-use PET water bottles are only recycled 
                     36% of the time in Australia ("Water bottle refill - University of Wollongong – UOW", 2020). With 
                     the low recycling rate, it is simply not sustainable if we continue to buy, consume and dispose of 
                     plastic water bottles in the manner and at the rate that we currently are.</p>
                  <p>To reduce the overall amount of bottled water people consumed in general, we focused our research 
                     on consumers' water drinking habits and why they choose bottled water over tap water. The taste, 
                     odor, color, temperature and quality of tap water all have influences on people’s drinking water 
                     choices (Delpla et all., 2020; Levallois, Grondin, & Gingras, 1999). Self-image is also a factor as 
                     to why people consume bottled water, particularly its trendiness and the image consumers wish to 
                     portray of themselves (Ballantine, Ozanne & Bayfield, 2019; Etale, Jobin & Siegrist, 2018). Another 
                     factor that contributes to the consumption of bottled water is the convenience and accessibility of 
                     water sources. It is easy to find bottled water in almost any store so people still consume bottled 
                     water when they are out and about even if they drink tap water at home (Etale, Jobin & Siegrist, 2018).</p>

                  <h3>interview & Survey</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p>We focused our interview and survey on people in Australia to gain insights on a local scale. Most of 
                     the findings overlapped with the literature and statics. However, no participants claimed that the 
                     brand identity influences their decisions on purchasing bottled water, but the fact that they have no 
                     suitable alternatives-the reusable bottles on the market do not fit into their lifestyles-even though 
                     it is realtively easy for them to find tap water sources. Participants who have reusable bottles, on 
                     the other hand, tend to forget to bring their bottles with them when they are out and about. We also 
                     discovered that the price of bottled water and people's environmental consciousness both affect the 
                     consumption of bottled water.</p>

                  <p>With the literature and user research in mind, we completed two comprehensively analyzed user 
                     personas around reusable water bottle user and people who purchase bottled water on a regular basis.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>We analyzed 4 digital products that have similar focuses to uncover design opportunities. Having 
                     tracking features seem to be a standard way of engaging with users especially for water intake. 
                     While most provide the function for users to discover clean drinking water sources, only one allows 
                     users to choose particular water that they prefer to drink. Additionally, none of these individual 
                     digital products support functions related to users reusable water bottles.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>The three of us came up with 1-2 ideas each ranging from bottled water that is made of environmentally 
                     friendly materials, special water dispensers that provide tap water with various of water flavors to 
                     smart water bottles with paired mobile app that support numerous functions to motivate people use 
                     reusable water bottles.</p>
                  <p>We presented our design ideas to our target users, discussed and iterated the ideas as a team that 
                     ‘the smart water bottles with paired mobile app’ would meet most of our user needs among all the ideas 
                     and match more comprehensively with the design opportunities. Additionally, we integrated it with a 
                     support system to further promote the use of this product. </p>

                  <p>The bottle is lightweight, collapsible and made of sustainable materials. It has flexible thermal lining 
                     protection to ensure water stays cold, and the ability to self-cleaning to maintain and improve the
